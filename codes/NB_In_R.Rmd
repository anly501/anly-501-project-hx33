## Read in data
```{r}
data = read.csv("../archive/StudentsPerformance.csv")
head(data)
```

## Using Grades as X and gender as y
```{r}
df = data[c("math.score","reading.score","writing.score")]
df$y = data$gender

# Splitting data into train
# and test data
split = sample.split(df, SplitRatio = 0.8)
train = subset(df, split == "TRUE")
test = subset(df, split == "FALSE")
```

## Using Naive Bayes to train
```{r}
classifier = naiveBayes(y ~ ., data = train)

y_pred = predict(classifier, newdata = test)
```

## Confusion matrix
```{r}
cm <- table(test$y, y_pred)
cm
 
# Model Evaluation
confusionMatrix(cm)
```
