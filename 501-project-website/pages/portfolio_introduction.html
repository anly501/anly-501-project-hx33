		My topic for the portfolio project is the situation of girls education in all over the world. Education is very important 
		for all the kids and teenagers, since well educated young people are the keys to the development of nations and mankind.
		In most countries, children and teenagers are provided with about 12 years of elementary and high school, and then they
		will apply and go to their desired university. During this process young people will learn basic academic knowledges
		and social skills which are crucial for them. 
		However, due to limited resources and economic issues a significant amount of kids and teenagers are getting little to no 
		education, and this situation is even more serious with girls comparing to boys. This portfolio is going to deeply look into this problem, 
		what is the current situation, what causes it, etc.
