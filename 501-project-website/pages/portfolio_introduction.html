		This portfolio project is looking deeply into the situation of girls education in all over the world. Education is very important 
		for all the kids and teenagers, since well educated young people are the keys to the development of nations and mankind.
		In most countries, children and teenagers are provided with about 12 years of elementary and high school, and then they
		will apply and go to their desired university. During this process young people will learn basic academic knowledges
		and social skills which are crucial for them. 
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:20px;">
		However, due to limited resources and economic issues a significant amount of kids and teenagers are getting little to no 
		education. They will often start working at a young age, usually doing phisical jobs with less wage. Also, lacking professional
		knowledge and skills will make them harder to find better jobs. This situation is even more serious with girls comparing 
		to boys. This project is inspired while I was browsing twitter, where I found its founder Jack Dorsey's pinned tweet was
		him funding about this issue. The article shared by project drawdown mentions that better education for all girls, women
		can lead to improved livelihoods, better economic opportunities, delayed onset of marriage, and delayed childbearing.

		<p style="font-size:20px;">
		This portfolio project is looking to find the detailed situation of how girls' education around the world. I will observe 
		from many aspects, so I created a list of questions:
		</p>
	
	    <h2>Questions for the topic:</h2>
		  
	    <!-- The <ol> ordered list element creates a list of items in sequential order. 
			Each list item appears numbered by default -->.
	    <ol>
		  <li>How many teenage girls out of all girls are enrolled in education? How does this proportion compare to boys?</li>
		  <li>What is the proportion between teenage girls and boys in schools?</li>
		  <li>Does the proportion of girls who are educated out of all girls change with education level (elementary, 
			  junior/senior high school, college)?</li>
		  <li>What is the proportion between girls who are educated and all girls like in different countries of the world?</li>
		  <li>What are the factors for the different proportion in each country (economic situation, cultural problems, 
			  or how much attention government pays)? </li>
		  <li>In a country like the US or the UK, is this proportion related to race? </li> 
		  <li>Does this proportion change over time? Do more out of all girls get educated these days comparing to past days?</li>
		  <li>How does the girls' grades compare to boys' during different stages of education?</li>
		  <li>In universities, what are the majors that have the most and the least female students? Is there a reason for this?</li>
		  <li>Do females that received at least 12 years of education have higher income than the ones who received little or 
			  zero education (less than 6 years)? </li>
		  <li></li>  
	    </ol>
		  
	    <h1></h1>
		  <p style="font-size:20px;">
		  My goal for this project is to answer the questions above (maybe more) with information that I get from lots of data.
		  At the end I will have a clear picture of how serious is the girls education problem in different areas, what might be
		  the causes, etc. My hypotheses are: less part of girls comparing to boys are receiving education; less part of girls 
		  are educated in less developed countries; girls who had full education have higher income than the one that did not.
