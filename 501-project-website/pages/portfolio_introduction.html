			<p style="font-size:20px;">
			This portfolio project is looking deeply into the education situation in the United States, specifically for female students. Education
			is very important for all the kids and teenagers, since well educated young people are the keys to the development of nations and mankind.
			In most countries, children and teenagers are provided with about 12 years of elementary and high school, and then they will apply and go to 
			their desired university. During this process young people will learn basic academic knowledges and social skills which are crucial for them. 
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:20px;">
			However, due to limited resources and economic issues a significant amount of kids and teenagers are getting low quality educations, or even 
			little to no education. They will often start working at a young age, usually doing phisical jobs with less wage. Also, lacking professional
			knowledge and skills will make them harder to find better jobs. This situation is even more serious with girls comparing to boys. 
			This project was inspired while I was browsing twitter, where I found its founder Jack Dorsey's pinned tweet was him funding about this issue. 
			The article shared by project drawdown mentions that better education for all girls, women can lead to improved livelihoods, better economic 
			opportunities, delayed onset of marriage, and delayed childbearing.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:20px;">
			This portfolio project is looking to find the detailed situation of education for the female students in the United States. I will observe 
			from many aspects, so I created a list of questions:
			</p>
	
	    <h2><center>Questions for the topic<center/></h2>
		  
		<ol>
			<li>In the US, what is the difference between girls and boys in terms of enrollments?</li> <br>
			<li>Is this situation related to different grades?</li> <br>
			<li>Is this situation changing over time?</li> <br>
			<li>What is the difference between female and male students in terms of getting college degrees?</li> <br>
			<li>What is the general college graduation rate for female students in The US?</li> <br>
			<li>What is the situation of attendence and dropouts for female students?</li> <br>
			<li>How does the girls' grades compared to boys'?</li> <br>
			<li>What are the factors for the different proportion in each country (economic situation, cultural problems, 
			  or how much attention government pays)? </li> <br>
			<li>In universities, what are the majors that have the most and the least female students? Is there a reason for this?</li> <br>
			<li>Do females that received at least 12 years of education have higher income than the ones who received less education? </li> <br>
		</ol>
		  
	    <h1></h1>
			<p style="font-size:20px;">
			My goal for this project is to answer the questions above (maybe more) with information that I get from lots of data.
			At the end I will have a clear picture of how serious is the girls education problem in different areas, what might be
			the causes, etc. My hypotheses are: less part of girls comparing to boys are receiving education; less part of girls 
			are educated in less developed countries; girls who had full education have higher income than the one that did not.
