			<p style="font-size:18px;">
			This portfolio project is trying to look into the education situation for female students in the United States. As we know, education
			is very important for all the kids and teenagers in the world, since well educated young people are the keys to the development of nations and mankind.
			In most countries, children and teenagers are provided with about 12 years of elementary and high school, and then they will apply and go to 
			their desired university. During this process young people will learn basic academic knowledges and social skills which are crucial for them. 
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:18px;">
			However, due to limited resources and economic issues a significant amount of kids and teenagers are getting low quality educations, or even 
			little to no education. They will often start working at a young age, usually doing phisical jobs with less wage. Also, lacking professional
			knowledge and skills will make them harder to find better jobs. This situation is even more serious with girls comparing to boys. 
			This project was inspired while I was browsing twitter, where I found its founder Jack Dorsey's pinned tweet was him funding about this issue. 
			The article shared by project drawdown mentions that better education for all girls, women can lead to improved livelihoods, better economic 
			opportunities, delayed onset of marriage, and delayed childbearing.

			<p style="font-size:18px;">
			This portfolio project is looking to find the detailed situation of education for the female students in the United States. I will observe 
			from many aspects, so I created a list of questions:
			</p>
			<br>
	
	    <h2><center>Questions for the topic<center/></h2>
		  
		<ol>
			<li>In the US, what is the difference between girls and boys in terms of enrollments?</li> <br>
			<li>Is this situation related to different grades?</li> <br> <br>
			<li>Is this situation related to different student races?</li> <br>
			<li>Is this situation related the poverty situation of the school/place?</li> <br>
			<li>What are the impressions from people about the situations of girls in schools and girls' education?</li> <br>
			<li>What is the difference between female and male students in terms of getting college degrees?</li> <br>
			<li>What is the general college graduation rate for female students in The US?</li> <br>
			<li>What is the situation of attendence and dropouts for female students?</li> <br>
			<li>What are the factors for the different proportion in each country (economic situation, cultural problems, 
			  or how much attention government pays)? </li> <br>
			<li>Do females that received at least 12 years of education have higher income than the ones who received less education? </li> <br>
		</ol>
		<br> <br> <br> 
		  
			<p style="font-size:20px;">
			My goal for this project is to answer the questions above with information that I get from lots of data. 
			At the end I should have a clear picture of how serious is the girls education problem in different areas, what might be
			the causes, etc.
