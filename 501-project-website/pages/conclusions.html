			After searching and cleaning datasets and texts, initial visualizings, applying different models and getting results, this project had successfully
                gained a few findings that can contribute to the data science questions and the main topic.
                
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:20px;">
			From preliminary data visualizing and exploring, it is found that the enrollments situations in the United States are indeed favouring
                the boys than girls, though the difference is not huge. Consider the fact that the gender ratio in the US is 98 males per 100 females, this
                fact suggests that girls have lower chances of enrollment to elementary, middle and high schools. 
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:20px;">
			When looking for what people are thinking and tweeting about girls in schools and general educations, it is worth noting that these are two different 
                topics and that people are showing care. While the tweets about schools and girls are mainly just "school things" like sports teams and boys, 
                many tweets about situation of girls' education are showing support, and are also talking about research, fellowship and dropouts. 
			</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
			More results are drawn using machine learning algorithms on the recorded and text datasets. The classification models that train with data and provide
                predictions to new data, like Naive Bayes and Decision Tree suggests that there exists a relationship between the grades and the 
                enrollment difference between boys and girls, while the races are not significantly related to this situation, meaning that no matter the
                race and ethnicity the difference of enrollments in boys and girls are constant. Also, from the unsupervised clustering model that did 
                not use a label, it is shown that the poverty situation of the school/area might be affecting the difference of enrollments in boys and girls.
