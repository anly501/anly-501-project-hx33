        <p  style="font-size:14px;"> Hello, I am Haiyu Xiao, a graduate student of data science and analytics program at Georgetown Universitity. I went to University
            of Washington in Seattle during undergraduate, and I was studying applied mathematics. Seattle was a very beautiful city with a lot of place of interests, 
            but I think Washington DC is just as cool. Since I got into my major during undergraduate, I have been learning about using math tools to solve problems
            in real life, and after joining the DSAN program here my professional interest is becoming even clearer: using different methods to find useful information
            from all sorts of data. This is also my basic definition of data science, as this modern world is creating large amount of data everyday, and these messy
            numbers are super beneficial as long as we use the right tools and procedures to make good use of them! I am very sure that throughout the program I will
            have better pictures of what a good data scientist should be capable of, as my ideal job after graduation would be a data scientist for an internet company.
